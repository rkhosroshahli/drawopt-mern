1- The data is not posted. maybe the post from front side is not sending or the back end is not connected.
2- Make sure the frontend sends the data via post in NewPoint.js
3- Check the NewPoint handler function is called.
Solved: The frontend does not call pointSubmitHandler function after button press.
